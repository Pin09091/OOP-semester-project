# OOP-semester-project
Three different approaches to my OOP end semester project
installation guides will pr available in each respective folder


1) Approach one used Pierfrancesco Soffritti's approach to detecting hand countours, the code was slightly edited as it had version conflicts with the current version of Opencv

2) Approach two used opencvs hand detection features, however the c++ approach used a modified dataset for the hands

3) Approach three was just a basic python script i wrote by following multiple online tutorials
